# 🔢 Number Guessing Game

This project is a fun and interactive number guessing game where players have 10 tries to guess a random number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on how far the guess is from the correct number in a sarcastic manner. Players can see their previous guesses to avoid repetition and keep track of remaining guesses. If the player wins, they receive a winning message; if they lose, the correct number is revealed. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.
